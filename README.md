## ✅ Project Contributions

This project encompasses a comprehensive data pipeline, with all components meticulously implemented, tested, and documented. The following sections outline the key phases and contributions:

### 🔹 Phase 1 – Data Collection

- Implemented a Python-based web scraper using **Scrapy** to extract: bank name, branch location, review text, rating, and date of review.
- Used **Google Maps search patterns** to locate bank branches in Morocco.
- Exported data to structured **JSON** and imported it into PostgreSQL.
- Designed and scheduled an **Apache Airflow DAG** to automate weekly extraction.

### 🔹 Phase 2 – Data Cleaning & Transformation

- Used **DBT (Data Build Tool)** to:
  - Clean raw review data (remove duplicates, missing values).
  - Normalize and preprocess text (lowercasing, stop words removal).
- Developed Python scripts to:
  - Detect the language of reviews.
  - Apply **sentiment analysis** using TextBlob.
  - Extract common themes using **LDA topic modeling**.
- Logged transformations and documented DBT models.

### 🔹 Phase 3 – Data Modeling (Star Schema)

- Designed and created the following tables in **PostgreSQL**:
  - `fact_reviews`
  - `dim_bank`
  - `dim_branch`
  - `dim_location`
  - `dim_sentiment`
- Used DBT to create SQL models and load data incrementally.
- Ensured referential integrity and optimized queries for BI tools.

### 🔹 Phase 4 – BI & Analytics

- Built a **Looker Studio (Data Studio)** dashboard:
  - Trends of customer sentiment per bank and branch.
  - Top positive/negative themes extracted from reviews.
  - Ranking of bank branches by average sentiment.
  - Interactive filters for location, bank, and date range.

### 🔹 Phase 5 – Deployment & Automation

- Integrated all steps in a single Apache Airflow workflow:
  - Daily DAG: fetch new reviews, update DBT models, refresh schema.
  - Included email alerts for DAG failures.

## 🔄 Data Pipeline Flow

The data pipeline is designed as a continuous flow, ensuring data is processed from raw collection to insightful visualization:

### 🏦 [Scraping]
Customer reviews and bank information are collected using `scraper_banks.py` and `scraper.py` scripts, which are part of the web scraping module.

### 💾 [Storage]
Raw data, initially in JSON format, is then loaded into the PostgreSQL database for persistent storage and further processing.

### 🧹 [Preprocessing]
This stage involves several critical steps:
- **Relative Date Conversion**: Dates in the reviews are converted to a standardized format.
- **Language Detection**: The language of each review is automatically detected.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Advanced Transformer models are applied to perform sentiment analysis on the reviews, classifying them as positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Topic Modeling**: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is used to extract dominant themes and topics from the customer reviews.

### 🤖 [Automation]
All the aforementioned steps are orchestrated and automated through the Apache Airflow DAG: `dag_load_reviews.py`, ensuring a seamless and scheduled execution of the entire pipeline.

### 🧱 [Modeling]
Transformed and preprocessed data is then modeled using DBT, creating well-defined fact and dimension tables in the data warehouse:
- `fact_reviews`
- `dim_bank`
- `dim_branch`
- `dim_location`
- `dim_sentiment`

This star schema design optimizes data retrieval for analytical queries.

### 📊 [Visualization]
The final stage involves connecting the PostgreSQL database to **Looker Studio** to create interactive dashboards, providing a visual representation of the analyzed customer review data.
